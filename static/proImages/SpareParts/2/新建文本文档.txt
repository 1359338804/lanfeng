Alloy ManHole


Technical Specificatons
Manhole is installed on the top of the tank, built Pressure&Vacuum Vent and Emergency Vent.

 
Advantage£º

¡¤ Pressure&vacuum vent,When inside pressure higher 6¡«8KPa or under 2¡«3KPa than the outside,will be open to balance the different pressure;when the different pressure less than -2¡«6KPa,the P/V vent will be closed to keep the product not voiatilized

¡¤ Automatic sealing of P/Y vent in a roll over situation prevents dangerous and costly spillage

¡¤ when the inside pressure is higher 21¡«32KPa than the outside,emergency vent will be open automatic to keep tank safe.The vent capacity is 7000m3/h

¡¤ Two-stage opening allows safe release of residual compartment pressure before fully opening the fill cap.

¡¤ Easy maintenance,convenience,safety

¡¤ Working pressure: 0.6MPa
