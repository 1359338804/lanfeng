YB Series Rotary Vane Pump



Technical Specificatons
YB Series Self priming rotary vane pump with internal by-pass valve. The pumps use a rotor with sliding vanes to draw the liquid. The material of construction is nodular iron with sliding vanes built in a special self lubricating material.Due to its efficiency the pumps can handle viscous and aiso volatile liquids and require less horsepower than other equivalent pumps.The pumps are capable of higher flow-rates at lower number of revolutions than other designs.

 

Advantage:

＃ Durable pumps for fast and quiet operation.

＃ Sliding vane design provides sustained performance and trouble free operation,high reliability.

＃ Adjustable relief vaive pratects pump from excessive pressure. 

＃ T-type strainers are available to protect pumping system fron damage caused by welding slag and foreign matter in the piping and tanks. 


Applicatin:

Fuel oil delivery truck, Fleet refueling, Lrbe oil, Aviation refuelers, Transport of Petro Chemicals, gasoline, biofuels, solvents and many more.

 

Installation:

The pumps are widely used on mobile applications or fixde installations. With cardan shafts or hydraulic motor the pumps can be installed on any kind of tank truck or they are coupled to electric or diesel engine on metal bases to be used either on terminals,heavy duty dispensers, pumping/metering skids, mobile transfer units. Equipped with Teflon seals the pumps can also be used on a wide variety of solvents in the petrochemical industry.
